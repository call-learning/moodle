This files describes API changes in the bigbluebuttonbn code.

=== 4.2 ===
* meeting:get_join_url has now been changed to get_internal_join_url and has become a private/helper method. This method should have not
been public as it exposes the real BigBlueButton join url that we should not expose (as the bbb_view.php should be our primary point of call
for joining and finishing a meeting).
* We use now an adhoc task to retrieve meeting information so to have unique point of communication between Moodle and BigBlueButton.
You need to make sure that the cron is configured for low latency adhoc tasks (https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/Cron#Low_latency_adhoc_tasks)

=== 4.1 ===
* External function mod_bigbluebuttonbn\external\meeting_info now return the list of the instance features and whether they are
  enabled or not.
* External function mod_bigbluebuttonbn\external\meeting_info may now return guestaccessenabled, guestjoinurl, and guestpassword
  if the callee can have access to them.
